## ASSN-2 - The /proc File System

Proc is a pseudo file system for interfacing with the kernel internal data structures. As a user, you can use proc files for system diagnostics  â€“ CPU, memory, Interrupts and many more. You can also configure a lot of parameters like scheduler parameters, kernel objects, memory and more

The common interaction with proc is using cat and echo from the shell. For example:
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo
echo "50"> /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms
```

This assignment will involve designing two kernel modules:

1. Design a kernel module that creates a /proc file named /proc/jiffies that reports the current value of jiffies when the /proc/jiffies file
is read, such as with the command

```cat /proc/jiffies```

Be sure to remove /proc/jiffies when the module is removed.

2. Design a kernel module that creates a proc file named /proc/seconds that reports the number of elapsed seconds since the kernel module was loaded. 
This will involve using the value of jiffies as well as the HZ rate. When a user enters the command
```
cat /proc/seconds
```
your kernel module will report the number of seconds that have elapsed since the kernel module was first loaded. Be sure to remove /proc/seconds when the module is removed.
